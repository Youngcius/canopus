# Canopus: Canonical Optimized Placement Utility Suite

Canopus (Canonical Optimized Placement Utility Suite) is a qubit mapping/routing framework tailored to advanced quantum ISAs.



Contributions：
- Unified and highly-effective qubit routing approach in canonical form, with properties of quantum ISAs tailored to the routing process
- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by gate commutation; while commutation relations can be uniformly described in canonical form
- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by qubit dependencies, which implies optimization in a more global scope
- Comprehensive analysis and evaluation with the underlying routing framework, for diverse quantum ISAs and hardware architectures, providing guidance for hardware-software co-design in real-world quantum program execution
