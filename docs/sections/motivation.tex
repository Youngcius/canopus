\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}




Two-fold motivations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The scalable qubit routing effects (2x-4x) is still a critical challenge in practical quantum computing systems
    \item How to utilize the emerging advanced ISAs (hardware breakthroughs); across all phases of compilation, routing is the bottleneck and is the most easily handled for co-optimization
\end{enumerate}


\ZY{Use a \dquote{optimal routing benchmark} to illustrate the OVERHEAD of existing methods}


\ZY{There should be many takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Previous routing overhead is not precise for hardware execution
    \item Previous routing is costly and also not precise for hardware execution
    \item SWAP can be implemented in low overhead (gate duration) with the recent breakthrough gate schemes for advanced ISAs 
    \item How to efficiently capture the rich commutation relations when performing co-optimization during qubit routing and gate scheduling
\end{itemize}

- depth driven

\textbf{Limitations of the conventional qubit routing models.} Conventional qubit routing models are limited and fail to exploit the versatile native gate properties, especially with the development of emerging hardware architecture. First, whether they focus on gate count driven or circuit depth driven optimization, they typically assume the realization cost of $ \SWAP $ gate is 3 times that of $ \CX $ gate according to the textbook $ \SWAP $ decomposition pattern. This assumption is not precise for hardware execution. For example, a combination of and $ \CX $ and $ \iSWAP $ is sufficient to realize a $ \SWAP $ while both $ \CZ $ (equivalent to $ \CX $) and $ \iSWAP $ are natively supported by the mainstream flux-tunable superconducting platforms like Google's Sycamore~\cite{arute2019quantum}. Such hardware even can natively support high-fidelity $ \SWAP $ implementation, with pulse duration 2 times that of $ \CZ $. Thus $ \SWAP $ itself is not as costly as what we usually think of. Second, although prior works pointed out that not all $ \SWAP $ gates cost the same when they are inserted on different positions within the circuit, they are still limited to $ \CX $-based representation. For example, \citet{liu2022not} leverages the feature than gate commutativity and selected $ \SWAP $ insertion can lead to lower insertion cost, however, the \dquote{not-all-the-same} cost they quantified is still based on three-$ \CX $-unrolled pattern. Using $ \CX $ gate as the basis is not accurate to predicate the actual circuit cost and thus constrains the co-optimization space for qubit routing.

of advanced hardware. Consequently, the true potential of diverse and powerful instruction set architectures (ISAs) remains untapped.


% For example, the $ \SQiSW $ gate was proposed as a promising ISA by \citet{huang2023quantum}, as $ \SQiSW $ has the half duration of $ \iSWAP $ gate, thus with a $ 2\sqrt{2} $x speedup compared to the conventional $ \CZ $ gate scheme on flux-tunable superconducting transmons~\cite{krantz2019quantum}. Moreover, $ \SQiSW $ is of greater synthesis capability than $ CX $, as around 2.21 $ \SQiSW $ gates are sufficient to synthesis arbitrary (Haar-random) 2Q gates~\cite{huang2023quantum}, while the number is 3 for $ \CX $~\cite{shende2004minimal}. Recent experimental breakthroughs even demonstrate that arbitrary 2Q gates (including $ \SWAP $) can be natively implemented in high precision on both fixed-frequency~\cite{yale2025realization} and tunable-frequency~\cite{chen2025efficient} transmons. The hardware vendors, including IBM, Quantinuum, IonQ, etc., have newly supported fractional/partial entangling gates as their new-generation quantum ISAs~\cite{ibmFractionalGates,quantinuumArbitraryAngleGates,ionqPartialGates}. Particularly, the continuous $ \ZZ(\theta) $ gates (equivalent to $ \XX(\theta) $, $ \mathrm{ZX}(\theta) $, $ \mathrm{MS}(\theta) $ \ZY{MS gate???}, etc.) jointly adopted by them provides more synthesis capability, and the optimal 2Q synthesis functionality with a discrete fractional gate set $ \left\{\ZZ(\frac{\pi}{6}), \ZZ(\frac{\pi}{4}), \ZZ(\frac{\pi}{2})\right\} $ was already implemented in \qiskit~\cite{peterson2022optimal,qiskitXXDecomposer}. Although designing a good quantum ISA is an complicated task, those basis gates with greater synthesis capability, shorter gate duration, and higher calibration efficiency are potential to provide superior performance for real-world quantum applications. Typical instances are selected fractional $ \iSWAP $-family or $ \CX $-family gates and heterogeneous/combinatorial basis gates.
