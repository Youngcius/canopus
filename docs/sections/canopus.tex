\subsection{Overview}



\subsection{Routing in canonical form}\label{sec:routing_in_canonical_form}



- Unified and highly-effective qubit routing approach in canonical form, with properties of quantum ISAs tailored to the routing process


\subsection{Gate commutation guided optimization}\label{sec:gate_commutation_guided_optimization}

- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by gate commutation; while commutation relations can be uniformly described in canonical form


\subsection{Qubit dependencies guided optimization}\label{sec:qubit_dependencies_guided_optimization}
- Capture optimization opportunities exposed by qubit dependencies, which implies optimization in a more global scope
