Advanced ISAs---$\Can$~\cite{chen2024one}, $\SQiSW$~\cite{huang2023quantum}


\canopus\ (\fullNameOfCanopus) is a qubit mapping and routing framework that is tailored to advanced quantum ISAs, such as $\Can$~\cite{chen2024one} and $\SQiSW$~\cite{huang2023quantum}, which are adaptive to versatile hardware architectures. \canopus\ is designed to optimize the placement of qubits and the routing of quantum gates, taking into account the specific requirements of these advanced ISAs.
